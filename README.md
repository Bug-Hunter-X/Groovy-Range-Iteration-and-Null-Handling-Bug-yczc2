# Groovy Range Iteration and Null Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common subtle bug in Groovy related to range iteration and null handling.  The `bug.groovy` file shows the problematic code, where a loop iterator continues to exist beyond the range it was intended for, causing issues if it's used later. The `bugSolution.groovy` file shows the improved code. 

## Bug Description
The bug arises from how Groovy handles implicit type conversions and range iteration.  When a loop finishes iterating over a range, the iterator variable may still retain a value. If that variable is not explicitly checked or reset, using it after the loop concludes can result in unexpected behavior or runtime errors. This is particularly relevant when handling functions that need to gracefully manage null or out-of-range values.

## Solution
The solution involves adding explicit checks to ensure the iterator variable remains within the expected range or handling null cases explicitly. This prevents errors when the iterator is used outside the loop's intended context.
